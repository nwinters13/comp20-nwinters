OMFGDogs Lab

The lab took me about 2 hours. I struggled to figure out how to use the 
mac I've been using. Also I couldn't get the link at the bototm right to
display when I was hiding the No dogs for you text with an indent. 

Switching to opacity for hiding text made this lab much easier.

Getting the audio to play was also a challenge.
