This was not that difficult of a project, it was more of a great
learning experience with javascript and interacting with the canvas

I was mostly surprised that it's written in the whitespace just gets
the colors of what it was covering with sprites, i was worried about that

Once i figured out how to get one sprite on there, I figured out how to get
them all. Getting the sizing and positioning was the only difficult portion.
