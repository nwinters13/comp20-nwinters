Introduction:
   The purpose of this assessment was to determine how the <a href="http://young-mountain-1326.herokuapp.com/">ScoreCenter</a> application created by 
   <a href="http://nwinters13.github.io/">Github User @NWINTERS</a> was vulnerable to outside attack and tampering. I carried out this attack on my own
   product because it was not worth hiring a real developer to determine the vulernabilites of this product because many were so apparent I could find
   them on my own (in reality my partner hasn't answered me in an hour and time is previous). These attempts to tamper with the app should help develop
   my skills in finding vulernabilites in code and help shore up my app from future attacks.

   The majority of these attacks focus on how data can be sent to the MongoDB server that holds all of the ScoreCenter information, as well as how the
     same information is read out from the server and posted to the ScoreCenter webpage which users will access in order to view their highscores, 
     as well as all highscores. The purpose of this assignment was to find issues in order to help protect users information, privacy, and innocence.


METHODOLOGY:
    The two types of tests carried out were black-box testing as well as stress testing. The black box testing was carried out by modifying the
      jquery post in my local 2048 game to modify what data was sent to the heroku mongolabs server. The stress testing modified that same
      black box testing to cause a large amount of sends to occur in succession, which put a heavy load on the server. These two simple testing
      methods allowed me to find plenty of vulnerabilites.

ABSTRACT OF FINDINGS:
    Most issues with programming and security occur at the interfaces of modules. In this case, that interface was where the server received and output
      the user data that it took in. The code did not attempt to prevent the user from inserting malicious or large amounts of information, and therefore
      left the website open to all types of attacks. The website will also let any website send information to it, rather than protecting itself and only
      accepting information from a list of trusted sites. In fact, a user could modify their user name at will, which prevents people from having unique
      usernames and therefore unique lists of scores. All of these vulnerabilites are detrimental not only to the basic purpose of the application, but 
      also could allow the website to be redirected to another website or crashed all together.



ISSUE: SCRIPT INSERTS
LOCATION: Jquery post in game_manager.js
SEVERITY: HIGH
DESCRIPTION: The fields within game_manager.js that send information to the mongo server can be modified to send
   any information, including script tags. Sending script tags allows alerts, redirects, and other actions to be
   carried out without user consent, which can be extremely harmful to any user that accesses the webpage.
PROOF: SCREENSHOTS OF ALERTS
RESOLUTION: A quick websearch of stripping script tags shows that saving information into an html div and searching
   for the word script, then removing that child, will allow script tags to not execute upon loading the webpage
   and render them harmless.

SENDING IMAGES:
    Security Risk: Medium
    This allows the user to display any image they want for any user to see. While this isn't immediately
      going to break the webpage, it could be harmful to users because they could be exposed to NSFW
      content without intent/express consent.


OVERLOADING SERVER:
     Security Risk: High
     When combined with the sending images in order to spam the server with high amounts of data to process
        at once, the app would produce an application error despite the database not being full.


SCRIPT INSERTS:

    High, as evidenced by the ability for ming to send people to kermit the frog saying yay

    FIX: Cast all things that you pull out of the post as something, so casting the scripts
         as strings should fix that issue
