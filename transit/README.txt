Name: Nate Winters
Assignment: Transit (#3)
Time Spent: 20 hours

Everything in the webpage has been correctly implemented. I can see myself, the correct line 
   (or an error if one exists) and the distance between it and myself. Also, when I click on my location
   I can see my location, and when I click on a station I can see the schedule and the stations name.
   The line has the polyline as expected and it is only the stations on the requested line that get rendered.
   I won't explain all the little details as the code/website pretty much speaks for itself.

I collabed some with Matt Long, Kenny, Lisa, and Emma. Pretty much whenever this
   assignment was being dumb I reached out for some advice on structure/optimal way to do things.
Ming's code on github was also useful/my main source of information for this project.

ALSO OF NOTE:
	I could not get nginx to download to I have a lot of commits. I tried to put meaningful
	 messages, however, and had to do this in order to debug my code.
